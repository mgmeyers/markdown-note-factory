# Markdown Note Factory

This extension provides helpful commands for creating new markdown notes within a workspace. Shout out to [Markdown Notes for VS Code](https://github.com/kortina/vscode-markdown-notes), where most of this code was extracted from. 


## Features

`command`: `Note Factory: New Note`: Prompts for a note title and creates a note within the `newNoteDirectory` specified in the config. New notes are created using config settings: `fileNameFormat`, `defaultFileExtension`, and `noteTemplate`.

`command`: `Note Factory: New Note From Selection`: Prompts for a note title and extracts the currently selected text into the new note, leaving a link to the new note in its place. Links to extracted notes are created using the `selectionReplacementTemplate` config setting.

You can also access this command from the context menu:
